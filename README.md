# DeeplySegment: Semantic Image Segmentation with U-Net

## Introduction
DeeplySegment is an advanced image segmentation project based on the powerful U-Net architecture, specifically designed for medical image analysis. This project focuses on the segmentation of skin lesion images to aid in the early detection and treatment of skin diseases such as melanoma. Our goal is to build a robust model that can accurately segment skin lesions, providing better diagnostic tools for healthcare professionals.

By leveraging the U-Net architecture, DeepSegment aims to achieve high precision and recall in segmenting skin lesions, thereby improving the overall effectiveness of medical image analysis. The model is trained on a diverse set of medical images to ensure it generalizes well to different types of skin lesions. {Note This is an on-going research project}

## Features
- **U-Net Architecture**: State-of-the-art deep learning model for image segmentation.
- **Customizable**: Easily adapt the model for different datasets and segmentation tasks.
- **Efficient Training**: Optimized for both speed and accuracy.
- **Visualization**: Tools for visualizing segmentation results and model performance.
- **Pre-trained Models**: Includes pre-trained models for quick deployment and transfer learning.

## Installation
To get started with DeepSegment, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/deeplysegment.git
   cd deeplysegment
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   Ensure Python 3.8 or higher and then install required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Download datasets:**
   Place your datasets in the `data` directory or specify their path in the configuration files.

## Usage

### Data Preparation
Prepare your dataset following the structure:
```
datasets/
├── train/
│   ├── images/
│   │   ├── img1.png
│   │   ├── img2.png
│   ├── masks/
│   │   ├── mask1.png
│   │   ├── mask2.png
├── val/
│   ├── images/
│   ├── masks/
```

### Training
Train the model using the following command:
```bash
python train.py 
```

## Model Architecture
DeepSegment employs the U-Net architecture, comprising:
- **Encoder**: Downsampling layers for feature extraction.
- **Decoder**: Upsampling layers for precise segmentation.
- **Skip Connections**: Enhanced information flow between encoder and decoder.
