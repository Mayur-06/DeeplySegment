# DeeplySegment: Semantic Image Segmentation with U-Net

## Introduction
DeeplySegment is an advanced image segmentation project based on the powerful U-Net architecture. It allows accurate pixel-level classification of images, enabling applications such as medical image analysis, satellite imagery processing, and more. {Note This is an on-going research project}

## Features
- **U-Net Architecture**: State-of-the-art deep learning model for image segmentation.
- **Customizable**: Easily adapt the model for different datasets and segmentation tasks.
- **Efficient Training**: Optimized for both speed and accuracy.
- **Visualization**: Tools for visualizing segmentation results and model performance.
- **Pre-trained Models**: Includes pre-trained models for quick deployment and transfer learning.

## Installation
To get started with DeepSegment, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/deeplysegment.git
   cd deeplysegment
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   Ensure Python 3.8 or higher and then install required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Download datasets:**
   Place your datasets in the `data` directory or specify their path in the configuration files.

## Usage

### Data Preparation
Prepare your dataset following the structure:
```
datasets/
├── train/
│   ├── images/
│   │   ├── img1.png
│   │   ├── img2.png
│   ├── masks/
│   │   ├── mask1.png
│   │   ├── mask2.png
├── val/
│   ├── images/
│   ├── masks/
```

### Training
Train the model using the following command:
```bash
python train.py 
```

## Model Architecture
DeepSegment employs the U-Net architecture, comprising:
- **Encoder**: Downsampling layers for feature extraction.
- **Decoder**: Upsampling layers for precise segmentation.
- **Skip Connections**: Enhanced information flow between encoder and decoder.
